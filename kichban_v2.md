⏱️ *1 phút*

### Bối cảnh sân khấu:
*Hà Anh, Hoài An, An Huê mỗi người cầm một tờ đề cương PDF in sẵn. Họ đang ngồi thảo luận nhưng vẻ mặt lo lắng*

### Hội thoại:

**Hà Anh:**  
"Everyone, our teacher sent the PDF study guide for Cambridge exam. It's complete - vocabulary, grammar, everything."

**Hoài An:**  
"It's complete, but this long list of concepts is hard to remember. Just reading on paper, how can we memorize everything?"

**An Huê:**  
"Exactly! The study guide only summarizes theory. I want to know how the real exam tests these parts."

**Hà Anh:**  
"There are many online exercises, but they don't match our school's specific content."

*Vinh bước ra, đi chậm rãi vào giữa sân khấu*

**Vinh:**  
"That's our situation. Teachers give us study guides, but we lack practice tools. Today, team Super Star redefines test preparation!"
